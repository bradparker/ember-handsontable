# Ember Handsontable

An Ember component wrapper for the Handsontable data grid editor

## [WIP]!

It should be relatively usable mind you. 

[ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/) has been used to generate the example app and test environment. You can find the component in `source/app/components/`.

## TODO

* Test and or add integration with Ember.Model and DS.Model
* Apply updates to collection, rather than simply relacing its content
* Packaging and distributing
